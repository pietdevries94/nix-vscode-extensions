# Nix VSCode extensions

I use this repo to auto update my vscode extensions. You can use this as an overlay and access the packages under `extra-vscode-extensions`.

The update script is based on https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/misc/vscode-extensions/update_installed_exts.sh

Check extensions.txt for the available extensions. If you miss something just send me a PR.
